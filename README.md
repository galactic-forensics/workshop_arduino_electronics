This repository contains
the notes,
code examples,
and any original figures and raw data
the workshop.

A direct link to the notes
in PDF can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galactic-forensics/workshop_arduino_electronics/main/notes_arduino_intro/main_arduino_intro.pdf).

## Figures

Figures are given
in the `figures` folder.
You will there find
`svg` figures
and python scripts 
to generate more figures.
There is also a file
called `requirements.txt`
that lists the python packages
that need to be present.

## Notes Arduino Intro

The LaTeX files for the notes
can be found in this folder.
All figures are located
in the `graphics` folder.
If python scripts or `svg` originals exist,
the filenames will be identical
to the files in the figures' folder.
