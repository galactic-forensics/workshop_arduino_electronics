# Exercises

This folder contains solutions to the code exerices.
All code examples are in project folders,
ready to use with the Arduino IDE.
Examples that are based on Arduino / Adafruit
examples that are available via the IDE
are not duplicated here.
These exercises are labeled below.

If exercises have multiple parts,
the code examples label them
using letters in addition to the numbers,
e.g., a for part 1, b for part 2, etc.

## Exercises that are based on example files

The following exercises only have minor modifications.
The Arduino examples are directly used.

- Exercise 0
- Exercise 6 (Soldering only, no code)
- Exercise 7
