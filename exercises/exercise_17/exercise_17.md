# Maximum cooling without fan

Without a fan, 
the peltier element starts warming up
even if set to maximum cooling.
The reason for this is that the cooling element
is slowly warming up
and excess heat is not efficiently transported away anymore.
Therefore, heat diffuses to the cool side,
heating it up.

Using the code from exercise 16
and simply unplugging the fan from the breadboard,
the cooler reaches a steady state above the room temperature.
At this point, the heat sink is fairly hot.
